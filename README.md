# RJ-TemperatureBehaviour-2021
Personal project of the temperature behavior in the State of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil during 2021. I analyzed data from the Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology's 23 automatic weather stations spread around the state. The project was made through a wide range of R libraries, such as ggplot2, tmap, tidyverse, and dplyr. Moreover, I generated a 3D map of one of the projects (Average Temperature during Winter Months) using a set of specific libraries.
